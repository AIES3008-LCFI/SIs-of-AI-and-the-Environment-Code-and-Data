# SIs-of-AI-and-the-Environment-Code-and-Data
This repository contains the code and data written, used and generated in the thesis 'Sociotechnical Imaginaries of AI and the Environment:  A Topic-Modelling-Informed Discourse Analysis of National AI Strategiesâ€™ Environmental Considerations', submitted for the MSt AI Ethics and Society at the University of Cambridge.

============================================================================

dissertation-topic-modelling.ipynb - this notebook contains the end to end code for downloading national AI strategies, pre-processing them, and training an LDA model to generate topics that are prevalent in them. To run and view the code with ease, please go to https://tinyurl.com/AIES3008-topic-modelling - this takes you to the Kaggle environment where you can just press play to run all the code with no extra steps.
(converted link to tinyurl for anonymity). View version 8 of the code to see the final run used in the thesis.

============================================================================

dissertation-reproducibility.ipynb - this notebook contains the data and code to exactly reproduce the final model used in the thesis. To run and view the code with ease, please go to https://tinyurl.com/AIES3008-reproduce-topic-model - this takes you to the Kaggle environment where you can just press play to run all the code with no extra steps (converted link to tinyurl for anonymity).

============================================================================

oecd-ai-all-ai-policies.csv - raw data from OECD AI Policy Observatory as of 01/05/25 - downloaded from https://oecd.ai/en/dashboards/overview

============================================================================

OECD_Strategy_Data_Download_Information.xlsb - filtered strategy dataset based on process laid out in thesis, with links to all documents, and information on how to download.

============================================================================

doc_downloader.py - this python program was written to automatically download strategy documents based on the filtered OECD dataset. To use this, pip install requests and pandas, run the code in the terminal and enter OECD_Strategy_Data_Download_Information.xlsb as the input argument.

============================================================================

final_docs_english.csv - the final pre-processed and translated documents, ready for use by the topic model. This file is used in the reproducibility notebook, as re-running the translation process may result in slightly different outputs due to reliance on non-seeded Google Translate.

============================================================================

model_tuning_results.xlsx - results from the training and hyperparameter tuning process, storing all hyperparameter combinations tested and their coherence/perplexity scores. This is used in the reproducibility document to select the parameters with the best coherence and train that model, avoiding having to retune.

============================================================================

topic_dist_per_doc_stats_and_imaginaries.xlsx - spreadsheet. containing the results of the topic modelling and of the discourse analysis for each document. Enviroscores for each document are calculated here, whether docs are over the cut-off, engagement levels, imaginary groupings, and graph creation is all in this spreadsheet. Raw spreadsheet was produced in the topic modelling notebook, with the rest manually added throughout the dissertation process. NOTE: as topics are zero-indexed in the code, they are in this spreadsheet as well, so add one to each topic_num for the true number.

============================================================================

strategies/downloads - folder containing all national AI strategy documents successfully downloaded in pdf form.

============================================================================

Topic_Model_Generated_Topics.pdf - list of all 25 topics generated by the LDA topic model, colour-coded for strong and partial environmental themes. These can be reproduced by running dissertation-reproducibility.ipynb at the Kaggle link.
